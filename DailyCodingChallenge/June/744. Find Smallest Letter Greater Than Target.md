### 744. [Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/)

**Level:** Easy

**Problem:**
You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character `target`. There are at least two different characters in `letters`.

Return the smallest character in `letters` that is lexicographically greater than `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.
**Solution:**

``` javascript
/**
 * @param {character[]} letters
 * @param {character} target
 * @return {character}
 */
var nextGreatestLetter = function(letters, target) {

    const n = letters.length  
    let left = 0, right = n - 1;
    while (left <= right){
        const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
        letters[mid] <= target ? left = mid + 1 : right = mid - 1;
    }
    return left == n ? letters[0] : letters[left]
};
```
