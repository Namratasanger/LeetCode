### 859. [Buddy Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/buddy-strings/)

**Level:** Easy

**Problem:**
Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` if you can swap two letters in `s` so the result is equal to `goal`, otherwise, return `false`.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.

## Approach
The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the lengths of `s` and `goal` are different or if `s` has a length of 1, it is not possible to perform a valid swap. In such cases, the function returns `false`.

2. If `s` is already equal to `goal`, we need to check if there are at least two characters that are the same in `s`. This is because swapping identical characters will result in the same string, which is the goal. To check for this condition, we create a set from `s` and compare its size with the length of `s`. If the size is smaller, it means there are duplicates, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

3. If the above conditions are not met, we need to find the first disparity between `s` and `goal`. We iterate through the strings simultaneously and keep track of the indices where the characters differ. We store the indices in `startIndex` and `endIndex`.

4. If there are more than two different characters in `s` and `goal`, it is not possible to perform a valid swap. In this case, the function returns `false`.

5. We check if the swapping indices are different and not equal to -1 (indicating no disparity was found). If the indices are equal or `endIndex` is -1, it is not possible to perform a valid swap. The function returns `false`.

6. Finally, we compare the characters at the swapping indices to ensure they match the corresponding characters in `goal`. If the conditions are met, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.


## Solution

```javascript

var buddyStrings = function(s, goal) {
    if(s.length != goal.length || s.length == 1){
        return false;
    }

    if(s == goal){
        return new Set(s).size < s.length;
    }

    let startIndex = -1;
    let endIndex = -1;

    // find the first disparity in the string
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
        if(s[i] != goal[i]){
            if(startIndex == -1){
                startIndex = i;
            }else if(endIndex == -1){
                endIndex = i;
            }else{
                // more than 2 different characters are present in the string
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // check if both the swaping index are different
    if(startIndex == endIndex || endIndex == -1){
        return false;
    }

    return s[startIndex] == goal[endIndex] && s[endIndex] == goal[startIndex];
};
```

## How to Use
To use this solution, you can call the buddyStrings function with two string arguments: s and goal. The function will return true if it is possible to swap two letters in s to obtain goal, and false otherwise.

Example usage:

```javascript
console.log(buddyStrings("abcd", "cbad")); // Output: true
console.log(buddyStrings("hello", "hlelo")); // Output: true
console.log(buddyStrings("abc", "abc")); // Output: false
```

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings s and goal. This is because we iterate through the strings once to find the first disparity and check for the possibility of swapping.

The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store variables.
