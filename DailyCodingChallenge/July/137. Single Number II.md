### 137. [Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

**Level:** Medium

**Problem:**
Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Approach


## Solution

```javascript
var singleNumber = function(nums) {
    let currBits = 0, ans = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < 32 ; i++){
        currBits = 0; 
        for(let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++){
            // shift i bits to fetch the ith position and then & with 1 to fetch the least significant bit
            currBits += ((nums[j] >> i)& 1);
        }

        // the least significant bit will be in group of 3
        // so a check to ensure whether ith bit(current bit) is 0 or 1
        currBits = currBits % 3;
        ans |= currBits << i;
    }
    return ans;
};
```

## How to Use

Example usage:

```javascript
const nums = [2, 2, 3, 2];
const result = singleNumber(nums);
console.log(result); // Output: 3
```

```javascript
const nums = [1];
const result = singleNumber(nums);
console.log(result); //Output: 1
```

```javascript
const nums = [0, 0, 0, -1];
const result = singleNumber(nums);
console.log(result); // Output: -1
```

## Complexity Analysis
The solution has a linear runtime complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the input array nums. This is because the solution iterates over each bit position (32 bits for integers) and each element in the array once.

The solution uses constant extra space, as it only requires a constant number of variables to perform the bitwise operations and store the result.

Overall, the solution satisfies the requirements of linear runtime complexity and constant extra space as stated in the problem.
