# 🚀 Daily Coding Challenge 🧠

Welcome to my Daily Coding Challenge repository! Here, you will find a collection of daily coding challenges solved using JavaScript. This repository serves as a platform for me to enhance my problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and track my progress over time.

## 🎯 How It Works

- Each day, I tackle a new coding challenge and provide a solution using JavaScript.
- The challenges cover various topics, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, and more.
- I strive to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code, focusing on both functionality and readability.
- Solutions are organized in separate folders based on the sequence number from leet code

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Namratasanger/LeetCode.git`
2. Navigate to the desired folder: `cd [folder-name]`
3. Open the solution file to view the code and accompanying explanations. 📝
4. Feel free to explore different solutions and compare approaches. 🕵️‍♀️

## 🎉 Contributing

While this repository primarily showcases my personal coding challenges, I'm open to contributions and suggestions. If you have a unique coding challenge or an alternative solution to an existing challenge, I'd be thrilled to review your code and consider incorporating it into the repository. 👥
